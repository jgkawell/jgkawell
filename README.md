## Hi there, I'm Jack ðŸ‘‹

I work on distributed systems in their many forms. I enjoy traversing the stack from IoT hardware up to global-scale clouds.

Previously worked at [Fluid Truck](https://www.fluidtruck.com/) and [Circadence](https://circadence.com/).

Other tidbits:

- ðŸš€ Bootstrapping [Home Cloud](https://home-cloud.io) and [Steady Bytes](https://steady-bytes.com)
- ðŸ’» Passionate about self-hosting
- ðŸŽ“ Currently learning NixOS

## Hi there, I'm Jack 👋

I work on distributed systems in their many forms. I enjoy traversing the stack from IoT hardware up to global-scale clouds.

Currently working on [Draft](https://github.com/steady-bytes/draft).

Previously worked at [Fluid Truck](https://www.fluidtruck.com/) and [Circadence](https://circadence.com/).

Other tidbits:

- 🚀 Bootstrapping *Home Cloud* (ask me more about this later 😉)
- 💻 Passionate about self-hosting
- 🎓 Currently learning NixOS
- ⚡ In love with Golang
